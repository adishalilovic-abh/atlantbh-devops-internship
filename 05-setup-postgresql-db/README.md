# Setup PostgreSQL database

## Task
[Spring petclinic rest app](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest) uses in memory storage by default. There is option to persist data beyond restarts using database. Create local PostgreSQL database which will be used for data persistence.

## Install PostgreSQL

If you haven't already, download and install PostgreSQL on your local machine. You can get the latest version from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or you can use homebrew:

```
$ brew update #update Homebrew to ensure you have the latest package information
$ brew install postgresql@16 #check whichh version is last
```

<details>
  <summary>Message after installation:</summary>

```
This formula has created a default database cluster with:
  initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /usr/local/var/postgresql@16
For more details, read:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/app-initdb.html

postgresql@16 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have postgresql@16 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@16/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/adinpilavdzija/.bash_profile

For compilers to find postgresql@16 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/postgresql@16/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/postgresql@16/include"

To start postgresql@16 now and restart at login:
  brew services start postgresql@16
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  LC_ALL="C" /usr/local/opt/postgresql@16/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgresql@16
==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql@16/16.0: 3,778 files, 66.5MB
==> Running `brew cleanup postgresql@16`...
Disable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP.
Hide these hints with HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS (see `man brew`).
```
</details>
<br>

If you need to have `postgresql@16` first in your `PATH`, run:
```
$ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@16/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/adinpilavdzija/.bash_profile
```

Check the Postgres server version:
```
$ brew list | grep postgres #check if postgres is installed or not

$ postgres --version
```

## PostgreSQL service

We must initiate the PostgreSQL service to establish communication with the backend. Start the PostgreSQL service with following command:
```
$ brew services start postgresql@16
```

When shutting down the application, it's necessary to stop the service. Stop the PostgreSQL service with following command:
```
$ brew services stop postgresql@16
```

## psql

When you get a connection to PostgreSQL it is always to a particular database. To access a different database, you must get a new connection.
```
$ psql postgres #connects to the PostgreSQL database named postgres
```

Create PostgreSQL database:
```
$ CREATE DATABASE petclinic;
```

Create user:
```
$ CREATE USER adinp WITH PASSWORD 'pass123';
```

Our user is missing necessary permissions for interaction with our database. **It is not good idea to give superuser privileges to user** because most users should be granted appropriate permissions and roles based on the principle of least privilege. This means that users should only be given the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious actions. You can use SQL commands like GRANT and REVOKE to manage user permissions and assign roles to users. 

For performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a PostgreSQL database, users typically need the following permissions on the relevant database objects:
- CREATE (for Create): Users need INSERT permission to add new records to a table. This allows them to create new rows in a table.
- READ (for Read): Users need SELECT permission to retrieve data from a table. This allows them to read (query) the data in the table.
- UPDATE (for Update): Users need UPDATE permission to modify existing re
- DELETE (for Delete): Users need DELETE permission to remove records from a table. This allows them to delete rows from a table.
- In addition to these permissions on tables, users may need permissions on sequences (for auto-incrementing primary keys) and any other database objects that are involved in the CRUD operations, such as views, stored procedures, or triggers. Auto-incrementing primary keys are often implemented using serial or bigserial data types, which are linked to sequences.

```
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE petclinic TO adinp;

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON owners, pets, roles, specialties, types, users, vet_specialties, vets, visits TO adinp;
```

Executing the `psql` command `\ds` provides a list of relations, including sequences. Grant pemission on sequences with following command:
```
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE types_id_seq, owners_id_seq, pets_id_seq, roles_id_seq, specialties_id_seq, types_id_seq, vets_id_seq, visits_id_seq TO adinp;
```

Change password if needed:
```
$ ALTER USER adinp WITH PASSWORD 'pass123';
```

## SQL basics <a name="sql"></a>

SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT.  
Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

- SELECT - extracts data from a database
- UPDATE - updates data in a database
- DELETE - deletes data from a database
- INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
- CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
- ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
- CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
- ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
- DROP TABLE - deletes a table
- CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
- DROP INDEX - deletes an index
