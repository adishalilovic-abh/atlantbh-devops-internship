## How To Install Angular on macOS <a name="angular_macos"></a>
[How to install Angular on macOS](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/install-angular/#how-to-install-angular-on-macos)

**1. Install Node.js and npm (If Not Already Installed)**
Download and install Node.js from following url: https://nodejs.org/en. 
Check your current Node and npm versions:
```
$ node -v 
$ npm -v
```

**2. Install Angular CLI Globally**
Just as with the Windows instructions, you need to next install/update Angular CLI, which is what you need to create (and manage) Angular applications. To do this, open the Terminal and run the following commands:

```
npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli
npm cache clean
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest #or npm install -g @angular/cli
```

```

npm ERR! syscall rename

npm ERR! Error: EACCES: permission denied, rename '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/@angular/cli' -> '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/@angular/.cli-G39XYeT9'

npm ERR!   code: 'EACCES',
npm ERR!   syscall: 'rename',

npm ERR!   dest: '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/@angular/.cli-G39XYeT9'
npm ERR! }
npm ERR! 
npm ERR! The operation was rejected by your operating system.
npm ERR! It is likely you do not have the permissions to access this file as the current user
npm ERR! 
npm ERR! If you believe this might be a permissions issue, please double-check the
npm ERR! permissions of the file and its containing directories, or try running
npm ERR! the command again as root/Administrator.
```
</details>

Solution for the error above:

Set the directory owner of /usr/local/lib/node_modules/ to root. Execute below command to set the owner to your user and after that repeat steps for installation Angular CLI Globally:
```
$ sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(npm config get prefix)/{lib/node_modules,bin,share}`
```

**3. Test Angular Installed Correctly**
After installing the Angular CLI, you can utilize its commands for managing Angular projects. To confirm a successful installation, run the subsequent command in the Terminal:
```
ng --version
```
You should see the version of Angular CLI displayed.

Possible error for the command above: You need to specify a command before moving on. Use '--help' to view the available commands.

Correct command:
```
ng version
```

## Angular frontend for Spring Petclinic <a name="spring_petclinic"></a>
Warning: **client only**. Use REST API from backend [spring-petclinic-rest](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest) project. You need start backend server before start frontend application.

**Clone project from github:**
```
git clone https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular.git
```

**Install local project package:**
```
npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@latest
if npm version > 5.0 delete package-lock.json file  #(bug in npm 5.0 - this file prevent correct packages install)
npm install
```
You can see current dependencies in package.json file.

**Development server**
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
